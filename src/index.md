Hello!
I'm currently employed as a web developer, but have previous experience in application support development and system administration on RHEL systems.
Check out further details about my career on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholas-ivkovic).

For my personal projects, I usually write F/OSS for \*nix and the web.
I have a bad habit of starting many projects but never completing most of them.
Check out the ones I have completed on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/n-ivkovic) and [GitLab](https://www.gitlab.com/n-ivkovic).
