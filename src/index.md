![Me](./res/img/me.jpg)

Hello, I write code for the web and \*nix.

I'm currently employed as a web developer.
I have previously worked as an application support developer and had some experience in system administration.
Check out further details about my career on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholas-ivkovic).

For my personal projects I write F/OSS for \*nix and a bit for the web.
I have a bad habit of starting many projects but never completing most of them.
Check out the ones I have completed on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/n-ivkovic) and [GitLab](https://www.gitlab.com/n-ivkovic).
